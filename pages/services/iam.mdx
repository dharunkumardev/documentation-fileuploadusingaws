## Identity and Access Management(IAM)
An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is similar to a user, in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and can't do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. A service role is a role that an AWS service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. As a service that performs backup operations on your behalf, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager requires that you pass it a role to assume when performing policy operations on your behalf. For more information about IAM roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.

The role that you pass to Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager must have an IAM policy with the permissions that enable Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to perform actions associated with policy operations, such as creating snapshots and AMIs, copying snapshots and AMIs, deleting snapshots, and deregistering AMIs. Different permissions are required for each of the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager policy types. The role must also have Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager listed as a trusted entity, which enables Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to assume the role.
