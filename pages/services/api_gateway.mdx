## API GATEWAY
 Amazon **API Gateway** is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API Gateway acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication applications. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls.

It Provides flexibility to use completely independent protocols allowing your microservices to communicate among themselves with ease. They allow developers to access the functionality of a subset of architecture in many different ways, without ever exposing the endpoints publicly. It doesn’t matter if you are using microservices or serverless architecture or a public API, API Gateways have a lot of benefits to offer.

And it acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result. ... Most enterprise APIs are deployed via API gateways. It’s common for API gateways to handle common tasks that are used across a system of API services, such as user authentication, rate limiting, and statistics.

This diagram illustrates how the APIs you build in Amazon API Gateway provide you
or your developer customers with an integrated and consistent developer experience
for building AWS serverless applications. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved
in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls.
These tasks include traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring,
and API version management.

API Gateway acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication applications.
