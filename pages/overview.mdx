## Overview About this Article

1. **Simple Storage Service(S3):**
   Under The Service we can create a Bucket for Upload Files.
2. **Identity and Access Management(IAM):**
   When an API is integrated with an AWS service (for example, AWS Lambda) in the back end, API Gateway must also have permissions to access integrated AWS resources (for example, invoking a Lambda function) on behalf of the API caller. To grant these permissions, create an IAM role of the AWS service for API Gateway type.
3. **API Gateway:** API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. In this article we are going to use this API for Upload files to S3 with the help of this service.
4. **CloudFront:**
   We Integrate CloudFront with S3 Bukcet for safe and caching copies of your content at its edge locations for get fast rather than get from S3
