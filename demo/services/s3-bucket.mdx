## Simple Storage Service(S3)
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. S3 is built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile applications.

Data is stored as objects within resources called “buckets”, and a single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size. Objects can be accessed through S3 Access Points or directly through the bucket hostname. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
